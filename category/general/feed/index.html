<p>We&#8217;ve finished processing the exams in my organisational unit for this exam diet. It all went well. So we&#8217;re done. Finally! Here are the stats on what the system achieved (with the help of 48 combined cores of processing and two additional staff doing processing for around the last five weeks, working together to support our the exams team). This system was also used by another organisational unit as well, as their <a href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/georgekinnear/2020/05/22/marking-remote-exams/">default option.</a> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-155" srcset="https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-1024x724.png 1024w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-300x212.png 300w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-768x543.png 768w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-1200x849.png 1200w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2-1980x1400.png 1980w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gradex-summary-v2.png 2046w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ve learned plenty about our behind-the-scenes exam processes and the limitations of PDF &#8211; this was definitely the right solution for us, for the emergency situation we were in, despite the immense amount of work to create it. It de-risked the process by keeping everyone&#8217;s work safe from edit conflicts between students and staff, and between staff members assessing it, as well as being backwards-compatible with the old Mk1 Human so we could revert to the pain of a fully manual process at any time if we hit insurmountable problems (which we didn&#8217;t in the end). </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Working with the PDF ecosystem reminded me why I prefer browser-based solutions &#8211; you can interact with the user and keep them on track. </p><cite>Me</cite></blockquote>



<p>An online electronic marking system is the way to go for us in the future. That&#8217;s possible for us now that we&#8217;ve taken that first step. Using a digital process that mapped exactly onto our existing workflow avoided a possible barrier to adoption of a new approach. Now our staff have seen the benefit of a digital workflow, we can have a chat about adopting a fully online system &#8211; especially since colleagues ran limited trials with other systems (interestingly, using this system to pre-process files before feeding them into the competition). The issues I ran into with the PDF ecosystem itself mean I don&#8217;t think a better user experience overall is possible no matter how good the underlying library that you use to work with PDF &#8211; you are still at the mercy of the interpretation of the specification for PDF by the viewing tools used by the staffs. We topped out on the quality of that experience, so time to move back to my favourite domain &#8211; the browser.</p>



<p>So, as you might guess, eyeing up the browser takes us smack bang into the territory already served by some existing tools. To compete or not to compete? This was not an easy decision because there is a really strong ethical benefit to operating assessment software from an open-source academic team. It provides an opportunity to fund the development from teaching income, and avoid the allure of monetising the student data. By the way, the reason that is even an issue for the edtech sector is that if you have shareholders, you have a legal obligation to do right by them, and that makes it rather difficult to leave money on the table (money you might need to stay in business, to grow, or to make a suitable exit for the founders). We can get around that by using a different funding model.</p>



<p>On the other hand, is it worth the effort to develop a tool which doesn&#8217;t monetise student data, but still (only) achieves the same (limited) academic outcomes? And how do you feel about that when you step back and realise you&#8217;d really like to see a bunch of change in the way things are done in that educational sector?  Is that a reason to aim for a seat at the table now, just so you can try and make change later? Or would that be so much effort you&#8217;d never get to the transformative stuff? And is the context in which you&#8217;d be operating sufficiently flexible that you can slot the transformative stuff into whatever you are doing, or might it not fit? </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a really excellent discussion of the difference between migration online, and transformation online, in assessment systems <a href="https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/2279">here</a> &#8211; an article suggested to me by Jen Ross, during a conversation we were having with Tim Fawns, who also added great stuff to my thinking (which I am not re-iterating here simply because it needs a proper writing out!) </p>



<p> There is no bald statement of the right path in that paper, but there is certainly a strong indication of the risk of getting bogged down in migration instead of doing transformation. What sort of development journey will evaluative judgement, contract grading, accept-revise, student-in-control grading, and various other practices need in order to flourish &#8211; and what role will digital assessment play &#8211; if any? Can you make a logical sequence of technical development moves to get from online &#8220;commodity&#8221; grading to the transformative stuff? Or are they paths that do not cross? In which case, what happens if you try to start with migration? What if you think there might be a way to do all of this without any traditional grading at all? (Health warning: people of a traditional disposition, look away now. Too late? Did I already say that? Sorry not sorry). Ok that&#8217;s clearly an extreme provocation. But it is a thought process I went through to offset the dangers of sunk-cost fallacy and train-track thinking (i.e. trying to avoid the pitfall of &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this, so I shall do more of this&#8221;). </p>



<p>How to resolve this in the case of future tools in the gradex ecosystem? Since academics who care about teaching, care about improving the experience for students, it seems a greater good can be served by focusing immediately on new practices that lead to better experiences for students and putting up with short term ethical concerns around any usage of existing commercial tools that fulfill a need. So gradeX development work is going to go on hold, while I bury myself in my keyboard again to deliver an open-source <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TimDrysdale1/federated-nontraditional-practical-work-for-engineering-education">remote laboratory</a> infrastructure over the coming months. I&#8217;ve a few other things up my sleeve as well &#8230; but more about those in good time! </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://gradex.io"><img loading="lazy" width="830" height="948" src="https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marking.png" alt="" class="wp-image-138" srcset="https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marking.png 830w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marking-263x300.png 263w, https://gradex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marking-768x877.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>pdf.gradex</strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> started life in April 2020 as a rapid response to the challenge of getting 50 colleagues to remotely mark 65,000 pages of scanned exams. When wrestling with the best way to get the job done in double-quick time, a bunch of exciting possibilities surfaced &#8211; why stop at a one-off patch when we can really benefit in the long term, as an academic community, if we build the tools that suit our local context and help others to do the same? </p>



<p><strong>Edit: </strong>just over two months on (June 11), this project is nearing completion of the first phase of development &#8211; just a few features to go and a few exams to finish off processing. Here&#8217;s an animation that is taken from the git repositories associated with the project, giving an idea of how I managed risk by developing critical features in isolation, then bringing them together in the integrated tool:</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s in a name?</strong></p>



<p>The X in <strong>gradex</strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />stands for</p>

<p>This pdf workflow is just the first &#8220;sub-domain&#8221; in a broader vision. </p>



<p><strong>But &#8211; solved problem, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yep, commercial marking systems <em>are</em> available, but there are good reasons not to settle for them. One of them is that sharing student work with third parties is a sensitive topic. This project aims to make it possible for institutions to keep that data in-house, where it belongs, yet still make significant efficiency, quality and equality improvements to their process. That&#8217;s keeping the lights on. What about getting the party on? By putting our code where our mouths are, we can explore the tensions between the latest world-leading research in education and the practical implications of those philosophies and values, without having to somehow keep a boardroom happy too. And how do we invite everyone to party in a way that suits them, or a no-party if that&#8217;s your preference? Digital tools <em>always </em>bake-in cultural norms, whether you are aware of it or not. Open-source (with a diverse <em>community</em>) is a necessary condition to overcome that. Of course, &#8220;necessary is not sufficient&#8221;, but we can&#8217;t start without open-source software that underpins the local and wider community. We have a long journey ahead to ensure equality, diversity, and inclusivity for all in education, and education is driven by assessment, so let&#8217;s keep that lever out in the open where we can see it and evolve it. </p>



<p><strong>Project status: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Proof of Concept and initial sense-check with colleages &#8211; <strong>done</strong></li><li>Phase one feature-set implementation (marking)-<strong> done</strong></li><li>Initial focus sessions with alpha testers &#8211; <strong>done</strong></li><li>Initial trials with beta testers &#8211;<strong>done</strong></li><li>Intended first use <strong>done</strong> (5000 pages processed so far in one day)</li><li>Round two feature set implementation (reporting) done</li><li>Round three feature set done (front cover pages, entering, moderation, cross-referencing of all pages)</li><li>Many more pages processed by a team of two &#8230; need to count them!</li><li>Now the default option in another School too</li></ul>



<p><strong>Risk management</strong></p>



<p>This system is decoupled completely from student submissions, so we can get on with receiving scanned electronic papers then bring this system in behind that to ease the workflow for markers and administrators. There is no lock-in, because it is just pdf &#8211; you can go back to the default human-intensive solution at any time (not that you will want to!)</p>



<p><strong>Potentially interested?</strong></p>



<p>Drop timothy a line (admin AT gradex DOT io) if you want early sight of in-development materials and some chat. Code freely shared already &#8211; documentation stills need backfilling, but the initial pre-release version of the command-line version of the tool is on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/timdrysdale/gradex-cli" target="_blank">github</a>. If you want to see details of the how things work under the hood, see the <a href="https://github.com/timdrysdale/gradex-cli/tree/master/parsesvg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parsesvg </a>library for how pages are designed in Inkscape.</p>
