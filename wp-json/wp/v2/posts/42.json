Or, if the image is unusable, you can flag it for further attention by your support staff, and they will be alerted when they process your marked scripts. If the image is good, you can TAB from box to box, entering marks, leaving your brainpower to focus on the marking task itself rather than how to get the marks onto the page. If you have a tablet or pen display, you can freehand annotate, and these will be safely flattened into images and preserved by the system without risk of erasing them at future steps. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/non-editable.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download the actual <a href=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mark-spread.pdf\">example here <\/a>.

So we can mix and match by flattening any annotations that are made on the script. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" src=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-1024x702.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"58\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod.png\" data-link=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/example-marking-page\/mixandmatchmarkingmethod\/\" class=\"wp-image-58\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-1024x702.png 1024w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-300x206.png 300w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-768x527.png 768w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-1536x1053.png 1536w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-2048x1404.png 2048w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-1200x823.png 1200w, https:\/\/gradex.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/mixAndMatchMarkingMethod-1980x1358.png 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The script &#8220;freezing&#8221; is using ghostscript to render the original image in the PDF so that it bakes in any annotations that the student has made (e.g. erasing mistakes or adding extra work).
