When wrestling with the best way to get the job done in double-quick time, a bunch of exciting possibilities surfaced &#8211; why stop at a one-off patch when we can really benefit in the long term, as an academic community, if we build the tools that suit our local context and help others to do the same? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Edit: <\/strong>just over two months on (June 11), this project is nearing completion of the first phase of development &#8211; just a few features to go and a few exams to finish off processing. Here&#8217;s an animation that is taken from the git repositories associated with the project, giving an idea of how I managed risk by developing critical features in isolation, then bringing them together in the integrated tool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/J0sxcWUOixU\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s in a name?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The X in <strong>gradex<\/strong>\u2122stands for<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>X as in &#8220;multiply your marking power&#8221; (automate tedious stuff);<\/li><li>X as in &#8220;you can mark anything&#8221; (on paper now, others later)<\/li><li>X as in connectivity networks between different marking tools;<\/li><li>X as in &#8220;no to surveillance&#8221;  (you control all your data); <\/li><li>X for the variable page size in the first tool <strong>pdf.gradex<\/strong>\u2122.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This pdf workflow is just the first &#8220;sub-domain&#8221; in a broader vision. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But &#8211; solved problem, right?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, commercial marking systems <em>are<\/em> available, but there are good reasons not to settle for them. One of them is that sharing student work with third parties is a sensitive topic. This project aims to make it possible for institutions to keep that data in-house, where it belongs, yet still make significant efficiency, quality and equality improvements to their process. That&#8217;s keeping the lights on. What about getting the party on? By putting our code where our mouths are, we can explore the tensions between the latest world-leading research in education and the practical implications of those philosophies and values, without having to somehow keep a boardroom happy too. And how do we invite everyone to party in a way that suits them, or a no-party if that&#8217;s your preference? Digital tools <em>always <\/em>bake-in cultural norms, whether you are aware of it or not. Open-source (with a diverse <em>community<\/em>) is a necessary condition to overcome that. Of course, &#8220;necessary is not sufficient&#8221;, but we can&#8217;t start without open-source software that underpins the local and wider community. We have a long journey ahead to ensure equality, diversity, and inclusivity for all in education, and education is driven by assessment, so let&#8217;s keep that lever out in the open where we can see it and evolve it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project status: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proof of Concept and initial sense-check with colleages &#8211; <strong>done<\/strong><\/li><li>Phase one feature-set implementation (marking)-<strong> done<\/strong><\/li><li>Initial focus sessions with alpha testers &#8211; <strong>done<\/strong><\/li><li>Initial trials with beta testers &#8211;<strong>done<\/strong><\/li><li>Intended first use <strong>done<\/strong> (5000 pages processed so far in one day)<\/li><li>Round two feature set implementation (reporting) done<\/li><li>Round three feature set done (front cover pages, entering, moderation, cross-referencing of all pages)<\/li><li>Many more pages processed by a team of two &#8230; need to count them!<\/li><li>Now the default option in another School too<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Risk management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is decoupled completely from student submissions, so we can get on with receiving scanned electronic papers then bring this system in behind that to ease the workflow for markers and administrators.
